<h1 align="center">:door: Welcome!</h1>

Feel free to take a look at my repositories.  
Most of them are records of studies and works I did in college, as well as some personal projects.

One of the works was the creation of a network communication application, implementing a text chat with audio transmission in real time. I developed an Android app with Java and Firebase: [chat-firebase](https://github.com/Andreick/chat-firebase).

I also developed a low-cost system for remote monitoring of vital signs as part of my final paper.  
The project uses the ESP32 development board, sensors and a blood pressure monitor: [ESP32-health-monitor](https://github.com/Andreick/ESP32-health-monitor).  
The most challenging was getting the blood pressure, I had to reverse engineer to hack the blood pressure device, the repository [blood-pressure-monitor-hack](https://github.com/Andreick/blood-pressure-monitor-hack) has the details.
