Feel free to take a look at my repositories.  
Most of them are records of studies and works I did in college, as well as some personal projects.

One of the works consisted of creating a network communication application, implementing a text chat with audio transmission in real time.  
I developed an Android app with Java and Firebase: [ChatFirebase-APS-2021](https://github.com/Bot-Mateus/ChatFirebase-APS-2021).

It was precisely this project that sparked my interest in the mobile world and today I am focused on learning more about this technology to become an Android developer.  
I'm keeping a repository with all Android projects I've been creating: [learning-path-android](https://github.com/Andreick/learning-path-android).
